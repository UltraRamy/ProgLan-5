2. It helped me notice which code takes more resource and therefore direct me which code to refactor
3. Yes,  IntelliJ Profiler is effective in assisting me to analyze and identify bottlenecks in my application code
4. Sometimes, my Laptop would get really heated up and the test status becomes unsuccessful and I overcame it by restarting the laptop and application
